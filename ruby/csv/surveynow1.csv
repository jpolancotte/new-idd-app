You did not ask about the negative, but here goes. Limited pharmacy services on the weekend are an issue, but my biggest issue is the delivery service you use.  Meds are usually not delivered at my houses until 10:30ish at night and once it was not delivered until 11:45 pm with a med we were out of and had reordered stat at 4:15 pm. This is a problem. Clients are asleep at this time and usually will refuse to take meds at that time (if it was something we were out of or is a new med that needs to be started ASAP) and there is not always a med cert person on the overnight shift."

Meds often do not align with cycles if not written ""just right"" by the physician. It takes days to weeks to clarify and receive some new meds. PA are taking weeks to get approved;often requiring our staff to contact the physician's office. Meds have been sent that were requested to be held. Meds were sent after hospital discharge after the person's same meds were dispensed for the July cycle. He now has double meds."
