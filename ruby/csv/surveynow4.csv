I run the whole residential side of an agency, I don't have time to send these things monthly - and nothing should be changing month to month unless a medication changed.

On Friday evening I had a very stressful situation with a dental practice that did not send an electronically signed prescription to the pharmacy and one of the prescriptions they typed out and sent back to the house with the client was for an antibiotic. The order stated the antibiotic was prn. When I called the dental office for clarification they were closed. I waited 2 hours for the on call dentist to call back. He stated the antibiotic was to be given every 8 hours and not prn. He stated he had no way to electronically send the script and it would have to wait until Monday.. I asked him to please call the prescription in and gave him the phone number. He reluctantly agreed to call but didn't. Between Richael and myself and many phone calls later he finally called the order in and Richael was able to fill it and have it delivered. 
I was very impressed with Richael and his professionalism and determination. (he was also very kind and not disturbed by my many calls back and forth to him). It was exhausting to both of us what we had to go through to get the prescription. I greatly appreciated how hard Rachael worked to make it happen. He's a 10 in my book."

One issue we did have was packaging of camp meds. Last year they were packaged for the week separate from routine meds. This year pre-labeled baggies arrived, which was a disaster. Hopefully next year they will again prepackage a week separate for camp"

You did not ask about the negative, but here goes. Limited pharmacy services on the weekend are an issue, but my biggest issue is the delivery service you use.  Meds are usually not delivered at my houses until 10:30ish at night and once it was not delivered until 11:45 pm with a med we were out of and had reordered stat at 4:15 pm. This is a problem. Clients are asleep at this time and usually will refuse to take meds at that time (if it was something we were out of or is a new med that needs to be started ASAP) and there is not always a med cert person on the overnight shift."

genia@sertoma.com,Genia,Rose,7/18/2024 10:49,5,9,8,5,"Issues: Having 2 cycles of meds (routine and controlled) makes double work for us. Meds often do not align with cycles if not written ""just right"" by the physician. It takes days to weeks to clarify and receive some new meds. PA are taking weeks to get approved;often requiring our staff to contact the physician's office. Meds have been sent that were requested to be held. Meds were sent after hospital discharge after the person's same meds were dispensed for the July cycle. He now has double meds."
